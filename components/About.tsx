              Hello there, my name is Carlos Cao and I am a Developer based in
              Auckland, New Zealand.
              <br /> I specialise in Backend Integration Development and have a
              background in Computer Science. I am deeply passionate about
              technology because of its limitless potential to create positive
              impact in our lives. From automating tedious tasks to solving
              complex problems, coding allows me to create solutions that make a
              difference. As a Developer, I take pride in crafting efficient
              algorithms and debugging complex software. I am always looking for
              ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest
              trends and technologies in the industry.
              <br /> Whether I am collaborating with others or working
              independently, I bring a sharp analytical mind and attention to
              detail to every project I work on. I believe that technology is
              more than just a tool it is a driving force behind innovation and
              progress.
