      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there, my name is Carlos Cao and I am a Developer based in
        Auckland, New Zealand. I specialise in Backend Integration Development
        and have a background in Computer Science. I am deeply passionate about
        technology because of its limitless potential to create positive impact
        in our lives. From automating tedious tasks to solving complex problems,
        coding allows me to create solutions that make a difference. As a
        Developer, I take pride in crafting efficient algorithms and debugging
        complex software. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and
        stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
        Whether I am collaborating with others or working independently, I bring
        a sharp analytical mind and attention to detail to every project I work
        on. I believe that technology is more than just a tool it is a driving
        force behind innovation and progress.
